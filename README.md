An accurate football prediction algorithm 
The question is,is it really possible to come up with a predictive algorithm that can process mutiple data points drived from collected data from multiple football historical data sources and come up with a feasible and high probability prediction for the possble outcome of a football match?
Can you leverage data analytics,game theory and predictive models to find a sustainable and consistently accurate prediction algorithm that has an over eight percent success rate irrespective of the national league the teams are playing in?
